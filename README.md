# OCaML
OCaML - Machine Learning with OCaml. Uses the [NEAT](https://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) algorithm.

# Notes
- This is not finished!
- Once it is done, it aims to serve as a guide to implementing NEAT in your preferred language. It also aims to stay completely faithful to the paper *externally*, BUT WILL make internal changes if I know of a more efficient way than the paper.
- Documentation so far, in various formats, is located in `OCaML-docs.zip`.
